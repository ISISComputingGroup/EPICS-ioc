        the exint Vi is an ISIS Vi that is used as a proxy for "set" operations when extint="true" is specified below.
		If your labview front panels are not "labview event driven" then you do not need to worry about this.
		If, however, they are (i.e. you would require the "signalling" version of the setControlValue() method) then you
		need to set the extint attribute to "true" on the relevant <set /> tags
				
		The path is parsed using EPICS macEnvExpand() and so can contain EPICS environment variables

	      <param> defines as asyn driver parameter that can be specified in an epics record to access data on the labview Vi. The <set>
                  and <read> items specify the name of the appropriate control/indicator on the LabVIEW Vi to access for these
                  operations. The "method" attribute controls the underlying method by which the new value is communicated, 
				  currently only "GCV" for reads (use DCOM exposed getControlValue()) and "SCV" for sets (use DCOM exposed setControlValue()) 
				  are supported. The meaning and use of the extint attribute has been covered earlier above.
				  
				  If you need a LabVIEW event triggered when the control is written to, use extint="true" with <set />, 
				  otherwise use extint="false"
